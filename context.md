# Context


I am building the backend of a Farmer's Portal using Core PHP and MySQL with a timeline of 3 weeks. The project consists of two major sections:
Project Overview:
1. E-Commerce Module:
   * Farmers can list products (name, quantity, price, images, etc.).
   * Consumers can browse products, add them to the cart, and place orders.
   * Order management system for farmers to track orders.
2. Auctioning (Bulk Trading System):
   * Retailers can search for farmers based on product availability.
   * Farmers and retailers can negotiate prices through a bidding system.
   * Real-time bid updates where farmers can accept/reject offers.
   * Secure messaging/chat system for price discussions.
   * Contract generation once a deal is finalized.
Tech Stack:
* Backend: Core PHP
* Database: MySQL
* Authentication: Session-based / Custom
* Communication: WebSockets (if needed) for real-time bidding
